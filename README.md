# genetic algorithm

this is a re-do of one of my first ever programming projects, a genetic algorithm in C++, which i initially made around a year ago. the genetic algorithm is an optimization algorithm which mimics natural selection. 

it was interesting to compare my previous implementation to this, and see how my thought process and coding practices have changed over a year (like learning how git works, plus actually using .gitignore - oldest commits for context).

`make run` for the default args, if you want to test using your own `target` and `population size`, `make` then `./bin/main <target> <population_size>`.

# Genetic-Algorithm
Developed my own genetic algorithm to learn the basics of the machine learning. Generates a society of chromosomes, which possess genes (aka vectors of 0's and 1's). Upon compilation, the fittest chromosome (fitness determined by number of 1's, which represent desirable traits) breeds with the second fittest, from which the offspring replaces the weakest chromosome. This breeding/crossover is determined by swapping genes up until a random point. There is also a random chance of mutation, which can either mutate an undesirable trait to desirable or vice-versa. Fitness is calculated after each crossover and mutation. Breeding and mutation is repeated in generations until convergence of the society (one chromosome possesses all desirable traits). One generation includes one round of breeding and one round of mutation.
